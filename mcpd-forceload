PRE-CHECK:

Confirm that all application teams have completed their pre-checks. 

On bigipviprion1 and On bigipviprion2:
tmsh show ltm virtual | grep "Availability     : available" | wc -l
tmsh show ltm pool | grep "Availability : available " | wc -l

K13030: Forcing the mcpd process to reload the BIG-IP configuration - https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13030

IMPLEMENTATION :

Save the config, Pull a config Sync over *from* Active to Standby, check cluster, touch MCPD file and reboot on both F5's 1 at a time starting with current Standby box

On bigipviprion2:
tmsh save sys config
tmsh run cm config-sync from-group ltmfailover
tmsh show sys cluster
clsh touch /service/mcpd/forceload
clsh reboot

Allow the chassis/blades 10-15 minutes to come back online from the reboot

Once bigipviprion1 is back online and stable, proceed with a failover and check cluster, touch MCPD file and reboot from bigipviprion1

On bigipviprion1:
tmsh run sys failover standby 
tmsh show sys failover
tmsh save sys config
tmsh show sys cluster
clsh touch /service/mcpd/forceload
clsh reboot

Failback to make bigipviprion1 the Active Unit again:

On bigipviprioncorpf2:
tmsh run sys failover standby
tmsh show sys failover

POST-CHECKS 

Application team has to do post-checks after mcpd forceload and reboot. 

On bigipviprion1 and On bigipviprion2 and make sure stats line up with Pre-checks:
tmsh show ltm virtual | grep "Availability     : available" | wc -l
tmsh show ltm pool | grep "Availability : available " | wc -l

Run a tail on the LTM logs for reported affected pools and check to see that the monitors are matching between bigipviprion1/2 as reported discrepancies were seen related to the incident:
tail -f /var/log/ltm | grep 'PRODPOOL-9142\|PRODPOOL-9159\|PRODPOOL-9172'
